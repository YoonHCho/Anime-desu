# Anime-desu

### A web application for Anime beginners who wants to get Anime recommendations

Although I do not watch Animes so much now, I decided to create this app since
I used to enjoy watching when I was younger. I thought looking at the pictures and
reading the synopsis of the Anime will bring back memories and thus I will enjoy
working on my first Project. I also wish the users of this app to get additional
information of different Animes and enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed creating the app.
